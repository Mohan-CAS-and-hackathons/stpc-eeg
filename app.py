        Modern electrocardiograms (ECGs) are vital for detecting cardiac issues, but their effectiveness hinges on signal quality. In many real-world settings, especially in under-resourced or rural areas, clinicians rely on low-cost, portable ECG devices. While accessible, these devices are highly susceptible to noise from muscle tremors, electrode motion, and baseline wander.

        **This is not a minor inconvenience; it's a critical diagnostic barrier.**
        - Research has shown that automated systems can miss up to **30% of acute heart attacks (STEMIs)** when the ECG signal is poor.
        - Field studies have uncovered significant rates of **undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (8% in one study)**, a condition easily detectable with a clean ECG but often hidden by noise.

        A noisy signal can lead to a missed diagnosis or a false alarm, both of which have serious consequences.

        **1. The Denoiser:**
        A **1D U-Net** architecture takes the noisy signal and reconstructs a clean version. What makes it unique is our custom **physics-informed loss function**, which teaches the model not just to remove noise, but to preserve the essential diagnostic features of a real heartbeat:
        - **Gradient Loss:** Enforces the sharp, high-velocity spikes of the QRS complex.
        - **FFT Loss:** Ensures the output has a realistic frequency profile, matching the harmonic signature of a true ECG.

        **2. The Classifier:**
        A lightweight **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** takes the clean, denoised signal and performs beat-by-beat classification, identifying potential arrhythmias according to the AAMI standard.

        This two-stage approach ensures that the diagnostic model receives the highest quality data, dramatically improving its accuracy and reliability.
