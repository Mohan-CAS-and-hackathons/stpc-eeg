# Community Projects

I don’t want this to stay just my project — here’s how you can join in:

1. **Try It Out**  
   - Clone this repo.  
   - Run `app.py` with a sample ECG.  
   - See the noisy → clean transformation in real time.  

2. **Tweak the Models**  
   - Play with training in `notebooks/ECG_Denoiser_Training.ipynb`.  
   - Add your own loss term or try a new architecture.  

3. **Contribute Datasets**  
   - Have smartwatch or portable ECG data? Add it to the `data/` folder.  
   - Let’s make the system more robust to new noise types.

This is meant to be a **living project**. Your small changes can help make ECG diagnostics more reliable everywhere!
