# ECG Basics 

Hi, I’m Mohanarangan, and here’s a quick crash course in ECGs.  

An **ECG (electrocardiogram)** is a recording of your heart’s electrical activity.  
It’s usually shown as a squiggly line that repeats with every heartbeat.  

The key parts are:
- **P wave** → atria contracting  
- **QRS complex** → ventricles contracting (the sharp spike!)  
- **T wave** → heart resetting  

Doctors look at the shape and timing of these waves to spot heart problems.

Why does this matter?  
Because if the signal is noisy or distorted, you could miss a life-threatening arrhythmia.  
That’s where my AI comes in
