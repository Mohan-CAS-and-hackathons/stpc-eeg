# How My AI Works ðŸ¤–

Hereâ€™s my two-step AI pipeline:

1. **Denoiser**  
   - Architecture: 1D U-Net ðŸ§©  
   - Special Sauce: I added physics-inspired loss terms â€”  
     *gradient loss* (sharp QRS spikes) + *FFT loss* (right frequencies).  
   - Goal: Turn messy ECG â†’ clean, realistic ECG.

2. **Classifier**  
   - Architecture: Lightweight 1D CNN ðŸ“Š  
   - Input: Beat-by-beat ECG snippets.  
   - Output: Five standard heartbeat categories (N, S, V, F, Q).  

Hereâ€™s the workflow:

The magic moment?  
When I ran a noisy signal through my denoiser, the classifierâ€™s accuracy jumped from **90% â†’ 96%**.
